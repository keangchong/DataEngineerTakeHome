# Data Orchestration
1. Data is written into Azure Blob Storage on a daily cadence in a csv file. Describe a process how you would create a new table in a Snowflake database off of the Azure Blob Storage source. We want the Snowflake table to be updated on a weekly cadence. Provide a written explanation.

  
 
2. Let's say the above data is in our Snowflake database and the end users are asking for delivery of insights. How could we make aggregated data available for an external user to consume? Give consideration to whether the client wants the data pushed to them versus available for them to pull when needed. Assume the data cannot be passed via an emailed csv.
